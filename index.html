                    Hi there, my name is Tony and I'm a fresh graudate from University of Oregon. 
                    In my free time, I enjoy going on a road trip and play some games.  
                    I believe that It is never impossible to fail unless I am not trying, 
                    and I try to incorporate that into everything I do. 
                    I'm excited to have the ability to create the any game, 
                    and I'm always open to meeting new people and trying new things.
